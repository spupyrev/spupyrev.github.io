<h3>
  <span id="linear">Linear Graph Layouts</span>
</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
In a total order of the vertices of a graph, two edges with no endpoint in common can be crossing, nested, or disjoint.
A k-stack (respectively, k-queue) layout of a graph consists of a total order of the vertices, and a partition of
the edges into k sets of pairwise non-crossing (respectively, non-nested) edges. This <a href="https://spupyrev.github.io/linearlayouts.html">page<a>
contains a detailed overview of open problems in the field. My favourite ones are as follows:

<ul class="bullets">
  <li>Is the queue number of planar graphs bounded by a constant?</li>

  <li>Is the maximum stack number of a planar graph three or four?</li>

  <li>Is the queue number of graphs with treewidth k bounded by O(poly(k))? The known upper bound is 2<sup>k</sup> - 1 and lower bound is k + 1.</li>

  <li>Prove/disprove the conjecture of Heath and Pemmaraju (1997) that the queue number of width-w posets is at most w. See <a href="https://dccg.upc.edu/gd2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/s4t2.pdf">[1]</a>.</li>

  <li>Do k-planar graphs (\(k \ge 2)\) have bounded stack number? This is known for 1-planar graphs, and and the best current uuper bound is \(O(\log n)\).</li>

  <li>What is the complexity of recognizing mixed (stack+queue) linear layouts? Does every 2-tree or every bipartite planar graph admit a mixed layout? See <a href="https://gd2017.ccis.northeastern.edu/files/session-05/pupyrev-mixed.pdf">[2]</a>.</li>

<h3>
  <span id="exttsp">Extended Travelling Salesman Problem</span>
</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
  Let G = (V, E, w) be a directed weighted graph where an edge (s, t) ∈ E has a weight, w(s, t) > 0. The goal is to find an ordering of V, \(π : \{1, \dots, |V|\} \rightarrow V\), so as to <em>maximize</em>
  the following expression, called ExtTSP:
  $$
  ExtTSP = \sum_{(s, t) \in E} 
  w(s, t) \times 
  \begin{cases}
    k_f\big(π(t) - π(s)\big) & \text{if } π(s) \le π(t)\\
    k_b\big(π(s) - π(t)\big) & \text{if } π(s) > π(t)\\
  \end{cases}
  $$
where the summation is taken over all edges of G and \(k_f, k_b: [0, |V|) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) are distance coefficients for forward and backward edges, respectively. Notice that the classical (maximum) Travelling Salesman Problem is an instance of ExtTSP when \(k_f(1) = 1\) and \(k_b(i) = 0\) for all \(i\).
We assume that both \(k_f\) and \(k_b\) are decreasing functions, that is, short edges are more important for the objective than the long ones.
We are particularly interested in the case when \(k_f(i) = k_b(i) = 0\) for all \(i \ge C\) for some constant \(C > 0\).
See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04676.pdf">[3]</a> for a practical instance of ExtTSP in the context of compiler optimization.


<ul class="bullets">
  <li>Is there a (constant-factor) approximation algorithm or PTAS for the problem?</li>

  <li>Can the above problem be solved optimally on control flow graphs (e.g., having small treewidth)?</li>
</ul>


<h3>
  <span id="minloga">Minimum Linear Logarithmic Arrangement</span>
</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
A linear layout of a graph \(G = (V, E)\) with \(n = |V|\) vertices is a bijection \(π : V → \{1, . . . , n\}\). In practice it is desirable that “similar”
vertices of the graph are “close” in \(π\). In the context of index compression, the following problem is defined:
$$
  \min \sum_{(u, v) \in E} 
  \log|\pi(u) - \pi(v)|
$$

It is known that the problem is NP-hard, see <a href="https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rpp0883-dhulipalaAemb.pdf">[4]</a>, but a number of questions remain open:

<ul class="bullets">
  <li>Is there a (constant-factor) approximation algorithm for the problem?</li>

  <li>Can the above problem be solved optimally for certain classes of graphs (e.g., trees or planar graphs)?</li>
</ul>
